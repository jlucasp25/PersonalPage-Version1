# Personal Page Version 1

First version of my Personal Page that contains project and work information.

The webpage is built using basic JavaScript and containers.

Project data can be inserted using a JSON file available in this repository, the main JavaScript uses this JSON data to dynamically create project entries.
 
This project isn't used anymore so it's available for you to use it.
